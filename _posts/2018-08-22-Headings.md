<p>Headings in HTML are essential, they can be used in subject titles, page names, etc. In HTML, there are 6 levels of headings, starting with <code>h1</code> which is the largest heading and going through <code>h6</code> which is the smallest. Usually, headings tend to be in bold text like this one:
<h2>example</h2> The same goes with the rest levels of headings.
</p>
<p>Using Markdown language, headers can be applied by adding square signs <code>#</code> indicating the heading level. An alternative syntax for h1 and h2 is to underline the header with <code>=</code> or with <code>-</code> for h2 headers.
<pre><code># This is h1 header
Or it can be this way
=====================

Header h2
---------

##### Header h5</code></pre>
</p>
<p> Links and pictures can be added by the following syntax:
<pre><code>[link title](actual link) for links
![alt title](image link) for pictures</code></pre>
Markdown is very simple, so simple that it is very good for writing lecture notes or webpage contents.
